<p>This package provides a simple framework for managing a single project. The framework comprises SingleProject and ProjectListener and an extension, SingleTransportProject, integrates a single media transport for use by project subsystems.</p>

<p>A project is nothing more than a name, backed by a directory, it's the responsibility of subsystems to do things such as opening and closing files used for susbsystem persistence. Subsystems will typically add ProjectListeners to the SingleProject and will then be informed when projects are opened, saved or closed.</p>
