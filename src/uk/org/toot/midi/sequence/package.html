<p>This package is concerned with the representation of Standard MIDI Files as Sequences.</p> 
<p>I suppose a further advantage of this package is that it is not controlled by Sun, and hence may possibly evolve at a useful rate.</p> 
<p>Many thanks to Matthias and Florian for their help on the Java Sound Discussion List and for the invaluable <a href="http://jsresources.org">jsresources site</a>.</p>
